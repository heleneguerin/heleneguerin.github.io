			<h3> Various information for research interns </h3>
			<p align="right"><a href="https://heleneguerin.github.io/students/stagiaires.html">Version française</a></p>
			<br>
			<h4 id="first"><span class="text-primary">First steps</span> </h4> 

      <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Visit the <a href="https://sciences.uqam.ca/stages-de-recherche/">Uqam Faculty of Science webpage</a></span> dedicated to research interns (in French). 
		<br>	
	      It explains all the important steps, including the very first steps to take.
			
			

			<br>
			The <a href="https://www.crmath.ca/en/fellowships-and-visitors/apply-and-useful-information/">CRM webpage</a> also provides valuable information (in English).

<br><br>
			<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">For scholarship recipients:</span> UQAM and CRM are very slow in paying out scholarships, so it's important to have enough money to support yourself for the duration of your internship.
			
			For short and medium-term internships, there is a strong possibility that the grant will be paid out once the internship is over.

			<br>
			To ensure that your payment is made as quickly as possible, contact the Faculty of Science contact person (<a href="mailto:stagesfs_recherche@uqam.ca">stagesfs_recherche@uqam.ca</a>)  as soon as you arrive in Montreal. UQAM will require the following documents (even for interns without a scholarship):
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>proof of private and/or public health coverage</strong> (copy of both sides of RAMQ card) for the duration of the internship,
				</li><li>	
copy of the <strong>birth certificate indicating the names and first names of the parents</strong>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br>
			<!--Immigration-->
			<h4 id="immigration"><span class="text-primary">Immigration</span> </h4> 
This section only concerns students who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of Canada. You need an up-to-date <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">passport</span>, with a fairly long validity period (please check).

		<br>
			The information below is provided as a general guide only. It is important to check on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html">official Canadian immigration page</a> the procedures you must follow to come to Canada.
		
						<ul>
			<li><div class="text-justify">
        		<strong>Short-term work permit exemption for researchers</strong>
				<br>
        			Adapted to interns who plan to stay less than 120 days (it is strictly forbidden to exceed this duration).
				The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/researcher-exemption.html">exemption for researchers</a> is obtained upon arrival at Montreal airport from immigration services, provided you have supporting documents (invitation letter, internship agreement, proof of funding, etc.).
			</div>
			
			</li>
		
		
			<li>
   			<div class="text-justify">
        		<strong>Work Permit</strong>
				<br>
        			If you cannot benefit from the work permit exemption, you will need to apply for a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents.html">work permit</a>.
				The procedures can take a long time, so it's best to plan ahead.
				<br>
				After signing the internship agreement, UQAM will provide you with an employment number that will allow you to start the process.
				<br>
				You can find out the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html">average processing times</a> for Canada immigration.

			<!--Health Insurance-->
<h4 id="maladie"><span class="text-primary">Health Insurance</span> </h4> 

			<ul>
			<li>
        		<strong> Countries with an agreement with RAMQ</strong>
				<br>
				RAMQ is the Quebec Health Insurance Board. <a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/health-insurance/social-security-agreements-other-countries">Residents of certain countries (including France)</a> have an agreement with RAMQ that allows interns to benefit from it for free and with no waiting period.
				<br>
				If you are eligible, you will need to request a form from your country's health insurance depending on your status (for example, <a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/media/2161">SE 401-Q-104 form</a> or <a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/media/2516">SE 401-Q-106 form</a> for French residents depending on their status).
				These procedures can take time, so do them as soon as you have your internship agreement.
				<br>
				Check the <a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/foreign-students-register-health-insurance-online">list of required documents</a> on the RAMQ website.
		<br> Once in Montreal, you can <a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/health-insurance/register">register online</a> for RAMQ.
			</li>
				<li>
        		<strong> Private Insurance</strong>
					<br>
					You can either sign up for private insurance from your home country or in Canada. For example, some banks like Desjardins offer this type of <a href="https://www.desjardins.com/qc/en/insurance/health-dental.html">insurance for healthcare and dental care</a>.
			</ul>
<br>
			<!--Other-->
<h4 id="autres"><span class="text-primary">Other steps</span> </h4> 
		<ul>
			<li> Notify your bank of your departure.</li>
			<li> Check with your mobile operator if you can use your plan in Canada, or use a temporary eSIM card.</li>
			<li> There's no need to ask your bank for Canadian dollars (unless it makes you feel better).
				<br>
You can use your Visa/MasterCard to pay (some stores refuse them), and ATMs to withdraw cash (there is one at the airport).
		</ul>

			<br>
			<!--Arrival-->
<h4 id="arrive"><span class="text-primary">Arrival in Montreal</span> </h4> 

			<ul>
			<li> <div class="text-justify">
        		<strong> Immigration on arrival at the airport</strong> <small>(for everyone)</small>
				<br>
        			<ul>
					<li>
						Get off the plane, head to immigration.
						<li> At customs, you will first enter your information on terminals (giant iPads) and scan your passport (if you have filled out ArriveCAN, the procedures will be faster and you will only need to scan the QR code).
							<br>
							You will be asked, among other things
							<ul> <li> the purpose of your trip: work/employment, ... </li>
							<li> the duration of your stay: enter the number of days between your arrival and departure (it must absolutely be less than 120 days for the researcher work permit exemption, otherwise you will have problems!).</li>
							<li> food/alcohol/others: If you have something, declare it! Check the <a href="https://inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-for-consumers/bringing-food-into-canada-for-personal-use/eng/1389630031549/1389630282362">list of authorized foods and quantities</a>. 
							</li></ul>
					<li>The terminal will print a paper. <strong>Keep this paper handy at all times!</strong>
							</li>
					<li> You'll pass in front of an agent, who will look at your paper, ask questions and ask you to go behind the counter into a glass box. This step can be very long.
						<br>You absolutely must go through the immigration counter to obtain your work permit or your researcher work permit exemption. Therefore, you must <strong>insist</strong> in case the customs officer asks you to go directly to pick up your luggage.
					
	</li><li>Then, you'll pick up your luggage, and pass in front of customs agents who will take the paper from the terminal. <br>
		At this stage, you may be asked to open your luggage (this happens often).
					</li>
			</div></li>
				<li>
					Take bus 747 or a taxi ($50-60) to your accommodation.
					<br> Bus 747 will drop you off at <it>Lionel Groux metro station</it> for the orange & green lines. The bus ticket is purchased at the STM terminal, which is just before the outdoor doors of the airport. 
					<br> The ticket costs $11 (valid all day, unlimited metro/bus transfers), but you can also directly buy a weekly or monthly pass on an OPUS card (no surcharge for taking bus 747 with a pass).
		
					You can buy it with your Visa/MasterCard. 
					<br>Buses are frequent and rather fast.
				</li>
		</ul>


			<br>
			<!--Accommodation-->
	<h4 id="logement"><span class="text-primary">Accommodation</span> </h4>

				<li>For short or medium-term stays
					<ul><li>Hotel M <a href="https://www.m-montreal.com/fr">https://www.m-montreal.com/fr</a>

						</ul>
				</li>

				<li>For medium or long-term stays
					<br>
					It is often easier to find accommodation or shared apartments once on site, so do not hesitate to take a hotel or an Airbnb room for the first few days.

			<br>
			<!--Miscellaneous-->
<h4 id="divers"><span class="text-primary">Miscellaneous Information</span> </h4> 
		<ul>	
					<li>The math department is located at the Faculty of Science, downtown Montreal, at <it>Place des Arts metro station</it> (green line). 
					<br>The 55, 80, and 24 buses have a stop right next to the Faculty of Science and are very frequent. <a href="https://www.stm.info/fr/infos/reseaux/metro/place-des-arts">List of transports to get to the Faculty of Science</a>.

					</li><li>Public transportation (metro/bus) is very efficient, so do not hesitate to look for accommodation outside the city center (expensive and not very pleasant to live in).
					</li><li> There are many bike paths and it is possible to subscribe to the bike-sharing service <a href="https://bixi.com/en/">BIXI</a> (think to bring a bike helmet in your luggage).
</li><li>
Some nice neighborhoods to live in: Plateau-Mont-Royal (Mont-Royal Metro, bus 55), Mile-End (Laurier Metro, bus 55, 80), Rosemont/Petite-Patrie (Beaubien Metro, bus 55), Villeray (Jean-Talon-Jarry Metro, bus 55), Parc Lafontaine (bus 24), Hochelaga (Joliette Metro, bus 125).
Students often live in Mont-Royal or Mile-End.
</li>
			<li> Tips: it's <strong>mandatory</strong> to leave a tip when you eat in a restaurant (except fast food): minimum 15% when you eat in, no tip if you take away.
				<br> It's usual to tip cabs and hairdressers (around 10%).
				
			</li>
			<li> Grocery stores/Supermarkets: the names of the stores for grocery shopping are <i>Metro, Provigo, IGA, Richelieu</i>, etc. You will find many small "zero waste" grocery stores.
				<br> Pharmacies (<i>Pharmaprix, Jean Coutu, etc.</i>) look like grocery stores, you will find medicines, shampoo, toilet paper, household products, milk, batteries, etc.
				<br> Dépanneurs are small grocery stores, found on almost every street corner, and are open late.
		<!-- 		<br> At <i>Dollarama</i>, you can find everything for cheap. 
				<br> There are many excellent bakeries, Latin American, Asian, Italian grocery stores,... the city is very cosmopolitan.-->
